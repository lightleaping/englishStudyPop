## Bored! lyrics

I'm so pretty

in your head boy, Yeah

Picking flowers

put em right behind my ear

Eyes catch you day dreamin

Look at the signs,

love as advertised

Feel the caffeine

Kicking in Uh

Episodic, visionary

Hit it like on mission

No used and recycled lines

Am I

Messing with you

When falling for you

Falling for you

(But I'm not the one to keep)

Falling for you

Falling for you

Lovin' with you

Takin up a good rush

Don't try to fight it

Paradise on venus in your eyes

I always come in hardcore

And love you til the day I'm Bored!

Takin up a new rush

I can't deny it

Turning your hellos into goodbyes

I always come in hardcore

Love till the end of the road

Then I tend to get Bored!

Better better,

always out for something better

be-better Uh

I just wanna feel the way

I felt the day we met

I keep falling for the feeling

But the feeling

finds a way to go away

So tell me where it goes

Out of my body

We're still pretty in my head

Keep picking flowers, Babe

I should've said it before

I got Bored!

I was

Messing with you

When falling for you

Falling for you

(But I'm not the one to keep)

Falling for you

Falling for you

Lovin' with you

Takin up a good rush

Don't try to fight it

Paradise on venus in your eyes

I always come in hardcore

And love you til the day I'm Bored!

Takin up a new rush

I can't deny it

Turning your hellos into goodbyes

I always come in hardcore

Love till the end of the road

Then I tend to get Bored!

I could never be your somebody

You could never be my somebody

Yeah, Maybe it's on me

I should've said it before

But I tend to get Bored!

Takin up a good rush

Don't try to fight it

Paradise on venus in your eyes

I always come in hardcore

And love you til the day I'm Bored!

Takin up a new rush

I can't deny it

Turning your hellos into goodbyes

I always come in hardcore

Love till the end of the road

Then I tend to get Bored!
