(Pretty pretty pretty pretty)

This that pretty girl mantra
This that flaunt ya
Just touched down in LA
Pretty girls don't do drama
Less we wanna
It'll be depending on the day

Pretty girls packed in a Defender
Know Imma defend her
Never let her catch no stray
This that pretty girl mantra
She's that stunna
Make you wanna swing both ways

Mix me with the drama
Check you like commas
My clothes are pajamas
Straight from the cold plunge

Daytime baddie use her mind
Quick switch of the fit for the night
Swerving through the lane
We'll be 20 minute late
Cuz we had to do a In-N-Out drive-by

It's not that deep
I'm not that drunk
Sometimes girls just gotta have fun
Throw it back
All that bass
Me & my sis way too attached

It's not that deep
We're not that dumb
Look at them Bonnies on the run
Inside glowing like the sun
You gonna feel us everyday

This that pretty girl mantra
This that flaunt ya
Just touched down in LA
Pretty girls don't do drama
Less we wanna
It'll be depending on the day

Pretty girls packed in a Defender
Know Imma defend her
Never let her catch no stray
This that pretty girl mantra
She's that stunna
Make you wanna swing both ways

Love what it feel like (feel like)
To be off of the grid like
All night
Ohhh with my B like (B like)
We ain't even tryna talk no one
Swerve off all the creeps
No weird vibes
We ain't never let it ruin a good time
Ain't nobody gon dim our good light
This them words we living by

This that pretty girl mantra
This that flaunt ya
Just touched down in LA
Pretty girls don't do drama
Less we wanna
It'll be depending on the day

Pretty girls packed in a Defender
Know Imma defend her
Never let her catch no stray
This that pretty girl mantra
She's that stunna
Make you wanna swing both ways

This that pretty girl mantra
This that flaunt ya
Just touched down in LA
Pretty girls don't do trauma
No new drama
We already got a full day

Pretty girls that you gon remember
Know that you could never
Nothing ever trigger me
This that pretty girl mantra
She's that stunna
Ereone know that she is me

(Pretty)
